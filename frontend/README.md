# 🌟 DevMatch AI - Frontend

Welcome to the **DevMatch AI Frontend Section**! 🧑‍💻

Built with React, this is the section that contains the user interface where users can input their GitHub username and job descriptions.

### 😃 **Awesome Features** (Because why settle for basic?)

- **Friendly Terminal Output**: It’s like looking at your profile through the eyes of a recruiter, but cooler. 😎
- **Error Handling**: Errors are handled beautifully so you won’t be left in the dark. If something goes wrong when calling **GitHub API** or **Pollination AI API**, you'll see friendly error messages like:

  - `"GitHub user not found! "`
  - `"Internal Server Error"`
