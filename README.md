# **Welcome to DevMatch AI** 💻✨

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to **DevMatch AI**,
a **personal assistant tool** with a sprinkle of AI magic!🌟. Ever wondered if your GitHub profile aligns with a job description? Well, we’ve got you covered!🚀

Whether you're a **developer** looking for a job, or a **recruiter** trying to find the ideal candidate, DevMatch AI is here to help. Just provide us with your **GitHub username** (and maybe a job description if you’ve got one), and we’ll do the magic! 💫

## 😀 **What Does DevMatch AI Do?**

It’s pretty simple:

1. **Analyze Your GitHub Profile** – We dive into the user GitHub activities, repositories and tech stack 🕵️‍♂️
2. **Match You to Tech Roles** – Based on the Github profile, we suggest the **best fit roles** the user can apply for (Frontend, Backend, DevOps,etc.) 🏆
3. **Get Your Match Score** – If a job description is provided, we compare it to the Github profile and give a **job match score** 🔍
4. **Career Level Estimates** – Entry-level? Mid-level? Senior?We’ll help you figure out where the Github profile stand! 📈
5. **Tech Stack Insights** – What are you good at based on your Github Profile? **React**, **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **Node.js**—we break it down

## 🛠️ **How DevMatch AI Works** (The Magic Behind the Scenes) ✨

This project is split into two main parts – the **frontend** (where all the magic happens!) and the **backend** (the hardworking server making sure everything runs smoothly).

### 1. **Frontend (React)** – The Snazzy Face 😎

- You enter your **GitHub username** and, optionally, a **job description**.
- React sends the data to our server and **waits for the results**.
- Once the backend does its thing, you get an **awesome terminal-style result** on the page.

### 2. **Backend (Node.js)** – The Brain 🧠

- Fetches your **GitHub profile data** using the GitHub API.
- Sends your info to **Pollinations AI** for analysis and role matching.
- The backend returns the data and **passes it back to the frontend** to show it off in style.

## 💡 **What's Coming Soon?**

- **Multiple Profile Comparison**: Compare up to **5 GitHub profiles** side by side.
- **Personalized Job Alerts**: Get notified when **new jobs** that match your profile pop up!
- **Resume Builder**: Generate a tech resume based on your **GitHub profile** and job matches.
